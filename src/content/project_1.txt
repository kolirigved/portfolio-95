PROJECT: Portfolio Site
Version: 1.0.0

This portfolio is built as a playful homage to Windows 95.
It features:
- Desktop icons that open draggable windows.
- Nostalgic UI components powered by React95.
- A secret Chess.exe app with a lightweight AI.

Tech stack:
- React + Vite + TypeScript
- Zustand for window management
- Styled-components for theme tweaks

Planned enhancements:
- More folders for case studies.
- Rich HTML project pages.
- Additional easter eggs hidden around the OS.

Thanks for exploring! :)
